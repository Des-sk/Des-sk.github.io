"Why did I decide to study Software Engineering?"... "But seriously, why?" These were exactly my thoughts when introduced to Iteration. Jokes aside, I started thinking about what made me want to study software engineering. The fact of the matter is I have so many reasons: career change, better opportunities, flexibility, acquiring a new skill, etc.

Three years ago, I got pregnant and started thinking of ways I could move forward to expand my career. I needed a position or job change, but in my line of experience, it wasn't a good time for a career change considering I was expecting a baby. It felt safer to use my experience moving forward. The plan was to keep working hard, get a raise, or a better job opportunity. Still, I started entertaining the idea of coding. I began reading about it and playing around with free online courses. Still, I left it there and focused on my pregnancy and my recruiter career at that moment.

A few months after I returned from maternity leave, I had to quit my job and stay home with my daughter. My plan then was to be a stay at home mom and study. Again, life happened, and that plan couldn't go through.

One day I heard that to make sure you didn't buy stuff that you don't really need, wait. If you can't stop thinking about it in X amount of time, then it's ok to buy it. That was exactly what was happening with my idea of learning to code. Every time I had to rethink my next move, I came back to it. Then I thought, I've done my fair amount of waiting, it's time to get it and try it out. So, here I am.  

Finishing this First Mile, challenging as it was,  reassured that I'm on the right track, and it wasn't "an impulse buy." I really really needed it.
